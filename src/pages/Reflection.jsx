      <p>According to the facts that were 
        laid for us even before we are born, the Earth was 
        formed 4.6 billion years ago.  We are living day to 
        day, and it seems natural, nothing extraordinary, so 
        simple. But thinking and reflecting on it, the world 
        we are living in is not really so simple. The world we 
        are living in is so complex that studying and trying to 
        understand it would I would say, impossible. From science, 
        engineering, biology, psychology, mathematics, and a lot more. 
        We may try to understand the world as a whole, but the wealth 
        of knowledge around the world is too vast. 
        </p>
        <p>No one can really understand all the knowledge of this 
          world, but we can at least appreciate it through mathematics. 
          Mathematics is a language to at least comprehend the beauty of 
          this world. Mathematics allows us to study the complexities of 
          this world and to identify patterns around us. If you try to look 
          carefully around you, you will see patterns. Patterns are everywhere, 
          which means, mathematics is also everywhere. 
        </p>
        <p>Mathematics is not just a concept nor a subject you take in your 
          school, it is more than that. Mathematics takes a crucial role in 
          shaping the world around us. From the design of nature to engineering 
          and architecture, there is pattern everywhere, there is mathematics. 
          Patterns are naturally ingrained to the world we are living. 
          It is not necessarily to go the tourist spot or famous place just to see 
          a pattern, it is already there wherever you are. So, look around yourself, 
          see the world, see it thoroughly. Donâ€™t just look, see and discover the 
          beauty and complexities of this world!
